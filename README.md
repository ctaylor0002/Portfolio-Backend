# Portfolio-Backend
Backend for portfolio website. Utilizes Django REST Framework as well as a MySQL Connector.

This project was initiated 5/6/2023 at 11:23pm. Ideally the goal is to get this project done in exactly a week.

The backend portion of this project should only need links to hosted projects from devCodeCamp. I would also like to look into setting up a live chat bot to send automated messages back to anyone that may look at my website. (Maybe document who has received a message or have them sign up for it so they can't receive it again)
